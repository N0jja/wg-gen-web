## Why another one ?

All WireGuard UI implementations are trying to manage the service by applying configurations and creating network rules.
This implementation only generates configuration and its up to you to create network rules and apply configuration to WireGuard.
For example by monitoring generated directory with [inotifywait](https://github.com/inotify-tools/inotify-tools/wiki). 

The goal is to run Wg Gen Web in a container and WireGuard on host system.

## Features

 * Self-hosted and web based
 * Automatically select IP from the netowrk pool assigned to client
 * QR-Code for convenient mobile client configuration
 * Enable / Disable client
 * Generation of `wg0.conf` after any modification
 * Dockerized
 * Pretty cool look

## Running

The easiest way to run Wg Gen Web is using the container image
```
docker run --rm -it -v /tmp/wireguard:/data -p 8080:8080 -e "WG_CONF_DIR=/data" vx3r/wg-gen-web:latest
```
Docker compose snippet
```
version: '3.6'
services:
  wg-gen-web:
    image: vx3r/wg-gen-web:latest
    container_name: wg-gen-web
    restart: unless-stopped
    expose:
      - "8080/tcp"
    environment:
      - WG_CONF_DIR=/data
      - WG_INTERFACE_NAME=wg0.conf
    volumes:
      - /etc/wireguard:/data
```
Please note that mapping /etc/wireguard to /data inside the docker, will erase your host's current configuration.
If needed, please make sure to backup your files within /etc/wireguard.
A workaround would be to change the WG_INTERFACE_NAME to something different, as it will create a new interface (wg-auto.conf for example), note that if you do so, you will have to adapt your daemon accordingly.
### Automatically apply changes using ```systemd```
Using `systemd.path` monitor for directory changes see [systemd doc](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.path.html)
```
# /etc/systemd/system/wg-gen-web.path
[Unit]
Description=Watch /etc/wireguard for changes

[Path]
PathModified=/etc/wireguard

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
This `.path` will activate unit file with the same name
```
# /etc/systemd/system/wg-gen-web.service
[Unit]
Description=Restart WireGuard
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/bin/systemctl restart wg-quick@wg0.service

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
Which will restart WireGuard service 

### Automatically apply changes using ```inotifywait```
For any other init system, create a daemon running this script
```
#!/bin/sh
while inotifywait -e modify -e create /etc/wireguard; do
  wg-quick down wg0
  wg-quick up wg0
done
```

## How to use with existing WireGuard configuration

After first run Wg Gen Web will create `server.json` in data directory with alla server informations.

Feel free to modify this file in order to use your existing keys

## What is out of scope

 * Generation or application of any `iptables` or `nftables` rules
 * Application of configuration to WireGuard

## TODO

 * Multi-user support behind [Authelia](https://github.com/authelia/authelia) (suggestions / thoughts are welcome)
 * Send configs by email to client
